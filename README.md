# CarDar Trading - Sales Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This was a freelance project developed for CarDar Trading, an online retailer specialising in car parts (brake pads, car batteries, and air filters).  
The objective was to forecast future sales based on historical monthly sales data, which enabled better inventory management, cost savings, and promotional planning.

## Forecast Targets
- Car Batteries (primary product focus)
- Supporting sales analysis for Brake Pads and Air Filters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statsmodels (ARIMA modelling)
- Matplotlib

## Approach
- Simulated realistic monthly sales data for three key automotive parts from January 2022 to April 2024.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify seasonal patterns and sales trends.
- Built an ARIMA(1,1,1) time series model to forecast Car Batteries sales for the next 6 months.
- Visualised historical and forecasted sales data for actionable business insights.

## Business Impact
Using the sales forecasts, CarDar Trading was able to:
- Optimise stock levels by aligning inventory with expected demand, reducing overstocking and storage costs.
- Improve cash flow through smarter purchasing decisions, avoiding unnecessary capital in excess stock.
- Plan promotional campaigns during anticipated slower periods to stabilise revenue.
- Enhance operational planning and customer satisfaction by reducing stockouts.

## Results
- Accurate 6-month sales forecast for Car Batteries.
- Identified seasonal fluctuations and sales trends across multiple product categories.
- Enabled data-driven decision-making to enhance business operations.
